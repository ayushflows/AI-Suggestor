## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   **Node.js:** Version 18.x or later (LTS recommended). [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
*   **npm, yarn, or pnpm:** Package manager.
*   **MongoDB:** A running MongoDB instance (local or cloud-hosted, e.g., MongoDB Atlas free tier).
*   **API Keys:**
    *   Google OAuth Client ID & Secret (from Google Cloud Console)
    *   OpenAI API Key

### Environment Variables Setup

1.  Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project.
2.  Add the following environment variables, replacing the placeholder values with your actual credentials:

    ```env
    # MongoDB
    MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    DB_NAME=your_database_name # e.g., ai_productiv

    # NextAuth.js
    NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000 # For development. Change for production.
    NEXTAUTH_SECRET=generate_a_strong_secret_key # A random string for signing tokens
    
    # Google OAuth Provider (Ensure these are for a client configured with http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google as a redirect URI for dev)
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret

    # OpenAI API Key
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
    ```
    *   **`NEXTAUTH_SECRET`:** You can generate a strong secret using `openssl rand -base64 32` in your terminal.
    *   **`MONGODB_URI`:** Make sure to include your database name in the connection string if your driver/MongoDB version requires it, or use `DB_NAME` if your `lib/mongodb.ts` is set up to use it.

### Installation

    *Note: If you encounter peer dependency issues (e.g., with `mongodb` and `@next-auth/mongodb-adapter`), ensure you have a compatible version of `mongodb` (e.g., `^5.9.2`) installed, as per recent project history.* 

### Running the Development Server

npm run dev
# or
# yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Building for Production

npm run build
```
This will create an optimized production build in the `.next` folder.
